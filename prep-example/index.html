    <!-- write your app ideas here ðŸ‘‡ -->
    I would like to build an app that helps those in the logistics field (since that's the field I work in right now). I would like to focus on creating an app that facilitates tracking and methods of obtaining shipment information. Other than the logistics field, I would also like to focus on building an app that facilitates making plans with friends and acquiantances. I find way too many times I try to makes plans with friends and it's impossible to find time when we're all free.
